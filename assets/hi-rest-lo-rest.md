# **Hi-REST, Lo-REST and Everything-in-between-REST**

21 Mar 2006

So [Don Box has unintentionally coined](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2006/03/18/20235.aspx) terms for a couple different kinds of REST.

Lo-REST

Just using GET and POST like HTML does today.

Hi-REST

Using all four methods (GET, PUT, POST and DELETE) like the Atom Publishing Protocol.

By why stop there? How about an intermediate level that just uses three methods?

Somewhere-in-the-middle-REST

Using just three methods (GET, PUT, and DELETE).

And remember, just using one method can still be RESTful if you use it correctly.

Didn't-even-know-I-was-doing-REST

Just using GETs to deliver hypertext. For example, syndication feeds are perfectly RESTful.

Of course, you can go too far with just one method, and start abusing it. That would give you:

Google-web-accelerator-road-rash-REST

Using GETs for things GETs shouldn't be used for. This is a synonym for [GETSful](http://bitworking.org/news/GETSful).

Now it's possible to use too many methods and not rely on the other aspects of REST such as hypermedia as the engine of application state. In that case you get:

All-verbs-and-no-resources-makes-jack-a-dull-boy-REST

WebDAV.

Now you may look over all these definitions and not see a definition of REST you like. In that case you have:

Rorschach-REST

If you squint your eyes hard enough anything can be made to look like REST.
